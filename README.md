# Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services

This project demonstrates how structured datasets can be ingested, transformed, and prepared efficiently using TensorFlow Data Services. The focus is on designing a reusable and performant input data pipeline, emphasizing data engineering considerations such as scalability, consistency, and pipeline optimization.

## Pipeline Scope
- Data ingestion from structured sources
- Schema-aware parsing and preprocessing
- Batching, caching, and prefetching for performance optimization
- Reusable input pipeline design

## Why This Project
In machine learning workflows, data pipelines often become a performance bottleneck. This project focuses on input pipeline optimization rather than model development, demonstrating how data handling can be designed as a first-class engineering component.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow (`tf.data`)
